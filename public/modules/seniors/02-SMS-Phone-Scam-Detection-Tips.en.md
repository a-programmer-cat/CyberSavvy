# 📵 SMS / Phone Scam Detection Tips

Scammers are getting smarter with technology. Here's how to spot and handle SMS or phone scams:

## 🔍 How to Recognize Scam Calls and Messages?

### 📱 Spoofed Numbers
- Scammers may fake caller IDs to look like banks, police stations, or government agencies.
- Watch out for unfamiliar local numbers, suspicious international codes, or numbers closely resembling official ones.

### 🗣️ Automated Voice Prompts
- Most scam calls use recorded messages saying things like:
  - “You are under investigation”
  - “Your package is on hold”
  - “Your account is frozen”
- Prompts to “press a button” or “call back a number” are red flags.

### 🚨 Urgent Tone
- “Transfer now or your account will be blocked!”
- “You are involved in a crime, cooperate immediately!”
- They create panic to force quick reactions without thinking.

## 🧠 How to Respond?

### 🧊 Stay Calm
- Don’t panic, no matter how serious the caller sounds.
- Legitimate authorities will not ask for money transfers over the phone.

### 🔍 Verify Information
- Hang up and call the official number from the agency’s website.
- Do not click on suspicious SMS links or call back unknown numbers.

### 🆘 Ask for Help
- Talk to someone you trust – family or friends.
- Report it to the police or national anti-scam hotlines (e.g., 997 or CyberSecurity Centre).
