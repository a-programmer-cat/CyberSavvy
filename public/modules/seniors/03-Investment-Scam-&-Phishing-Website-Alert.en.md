# ⚠️ Investment Scam & Phishing Website Alert

## 🎯 Common Local Scam Cases

Scammers are using increasingly deceptive tactics. Here are some typical ones:

- **Fake Investment Platforms**: Look like legitimate financial websites but are actually scams.
- **"Get-Rich-Quick" Traps**: Promises of high returns like “RM1,000 a day” with no risk — usually Ponzi schemes.
- **Social Media Phishing**: Ads on WhatsApp, Telegram, or Facebook directing users to scam links.

> 📌 Example: Mr. Lee invested RM5,000 in an "automated crypto trading platform" he saw on Facebook. After a few days, the platform became inaccessible and all contact stopped — it was a scam.

## 🔍 How to Check If a Website is Legit

To avoid scams, always verify the website:

### ✅ Check the Domain Name
- Real sites have clean and official domains like `www.maybank2u.com.my`
- Scam sites often use misspelled or suspicious domains like `maybank-login-secure.net`

### ✅ Look for HTTPS 🔒
- Ensure the URL starts with `https://` and shows a secure padlock icon
- Do **not** enter information on sites that show a 🔓 or only `http://`

### ✅ Verify with Authorities
- Confirm the platform is registered with **Securities Commission Malaysia (SC)** or **Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM)**
- Use official sources:
  - [https://www.sc.com.my](https://www.sc.com.my)
  - [https://bnm.gov.my](https://bnm.gov.my)
