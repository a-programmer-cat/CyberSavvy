## 🛡 What is MFA?

Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is a security method where you verify your identity using **two or more factors**, usually after entering your password.

Common MFA types:

- 📱 SMS verification codes
- 📲 Authenticator apps (e.g., Google Authenticator, Authy, Microsoft Authenticator)
- 🔐 Hardware keys (e.g., YubiKey)

## ✅ MFA Best Practices

- Prefer authenticator apps over SMS (more secure)  
- Enable MFA on critical accounts: Gmail, Facebook, Instagram, banking apps  
- Save backup/recovery codes in a safe place  
- Don’t rely solely on SMS due to SIM swap risks
