# Information Protection & Regulatory Compliance 📚🔐

In today's data-driven world, businesses must protect customer personal data and comply with relevant data protection laws. In Malaysia, the Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA) is the key regulation for ensuring lawful and responsible data handling.

## 🇲🇾 Introduction to Malaysia's PDPA

Enforced since 2010, the PDPA governs how commercial organizations collect, store, process, and disclose personal data, ensuring the privacy rights of individuals are respected.

## 📌 The 7 Personal Data Protection Principles:

1. **General Principle**: Personal data must be collected with the individual's consent.
2. **Notice and Choice Principle**: Organizations must inform individuals about data usage and offer the choice to opt-out.
3. **Disclosure Principle**: No personal data can be shared with third parties without consent.
4. **Security Principle**: Adequate security measures must be implemented to protect data.
5. **Retention Principle**: Data must not be retained longer than necessary.
6. **Data Integrity Principle**: Data must be accurate, complete, and up-to-date.
7. **Access Principle**: Individuals have the right to access and correct their data.

## 🛡️ What Must Businesses Do?

- Establish a clear and accessible data privacy policy
- Strengthen system security (e.g., encryption, access control)
- Train employees on data protection practices
- Appoint a Data Protection Officer (DPO)

## ⚠️ What Are the Consequences of Non-Compliance?

- **Hefty fines** (up to RM 500,000)

- **Reputational damage** and loss of customer trust

💡 **Compliance is not just legal — it's essential for customer trust.**
