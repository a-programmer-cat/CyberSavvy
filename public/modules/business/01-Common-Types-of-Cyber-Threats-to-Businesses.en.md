# Common Types of Cyber Threats to Businesses 💻🛡️

As cyber threats become increasingly sophisticated, businesses are exposed to growing risks. Here are some common types of cyberattacks:

## 1️⃣ Email Fraud ✉️

Cybercriminals impersonate trusted individuals or companies via email to trick employees into clicking malicious links or downloading harmful attachments.

🔍 Typical signs:
- Spoofed domains (e.g., `@micr0soft.com`)
- Urgent tone demanding immediate action
- Suspicious attachments or links

## 2️⃣ Business Email Compromise (BEC) 🏢📩

BEC is a targeted attack where criminals impersonate executives, vendors, or partners to trick employees—especially in finance or procurement—into transferring funds or disclosing sensitive information.

🎯 Targets:
- Trick finance departments into wire transfers
- Steal sensitive data
- Fake vendor account change requests

## 3️⃣ Ransomware Attacks 🧨💾

Ransomware encrypts company files and demands payment to unlock them. These attacks spread via email attachments, malicious websites, or system vulnerabilities.

⚠️ Consequences:
- System downtime
- Data loss or breach
- Large financial losses

## 4️⃣ Fake Invoice Scam 🧾❗

Attackers send fake invoices to the finance department that look legitimate but contain fraudulent payment details.

🧠 Prevention tips:
- Verify invoice sources
- Double-check bank account changes
- Use multi-step payment approval processes
