# 🏠 Family Online Risk Overview

As digital devices become essential in daily life, families—especially children—are increasingly exposed to online risks. It's crucial for parents to guide and protect their children in the digital world.

## 🔐 Social Media Privacy Settings & Account Sharing Risks

- **Regularly review privacy settings**: Make sure social media accounts (e.g., Instagram, TikTok, Facebook) are set to private to limit exposure to strangers.
- **Avoid sharing sensitive personal details**: Refrain from posting your home address, school names, or daily routines.
- **Risks of account sharing**:
  - Children may share passwords with friends, risking account hijacking or misuse.
  - Others may post harmful content using the child’s account, damaging reputation or leading to legal issues.

## ⚠️ Preventing Online Shopping & Gaming Scams

- **Teach kids to identify scam websites**:
  - Avoid “too good to be true” offers like 90% discounts or “last-minute sales.”
  - Do not click unfamiliar links, especially those shared via messaging apps or social media.
- **Be aware of gaming-related scams**:
  - Warn kids not to trust offers like “free skins” or “top-up services” from strangers.
  - Never share game login credentials or payment information.
- **Parental actions to take**:
  - Enable payment verification to prevent unauthorized purchases.
  - Use parental controls to monitor and limit screen time and app usage.
