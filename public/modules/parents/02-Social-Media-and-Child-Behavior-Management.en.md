# 🌐 Social Media and Child Behavior Management

With the increasing use of social platforms, children are getting exposed to the online world at an early age. Parents must guide them to use it safely. Here are some detailed suggestions:

## 🔒 How to Set Privacy Controls

1. **Enable privacy settings**: Make sure your child’s account is set to “private,” allowing only friends to see their content.
2. **Control who can message**: Restrict messages or comments to approved contacts only.
3. **Disable location-based features**: Prevent strangers from discovering your child via location.
4. **Adjust content visibility**: Set who can view posts—only me, friends, or public.

## 🚫 Filtering Friend Requests and Identifying Strangers

1. **Decline unknown friend requests**: Teach children to ignore suspicious or unknown invites.
2. **Spot fake accounts**: Be wary of accounts with blurry photos or no personal details.
3. **Report suspicious activity**: Use the platform’s report tool for harassment or inappropriate behavior.
4. **Clean up contact lists regularly**: Remove people they no longer know or talk to.

## 🧠 Teach Children to Protect Personal Info

1. **Do not share live location**📍: Avoid posting check-ins or current whereabouts online.
2. **Keep family info private**🏠: Don’t mention parents’ jobs, siblings’ names, or home address.
3. **Be cautious with photos**📸: Uniforms, street signs, or landmarks can give away locations.
4. **Encourage pre-post review**✅: Ask kids to show parents before sharing sensitive posts.

👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Remember: Parental guidance is the first and most vital layer of digital safety.
